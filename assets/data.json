    "description": "When someone applies to a part time opportunity, this notification gets sent to the creator. \"Part time\" is a Agency-only (GSA-only for now) task that is not a full-time detail. This is a system notification for Agency-restricted opportunities. We want to do this in a way that can scale for other agencies.\r\n\r\nThis story contemplates creating custom notifications for Agency-restricted opportunities. And creating one for Agency-restricted opportunities that are not full-time details. Right now full-time details are hard-coded to be a GSA only opportunity type this needs to be generalized as well\r\n\r\nSuggested implementation\r\n- `api\/notifications\/task.create.draft\/template.html` _default notification_\r\n- `api\/notifications\/<AGENCY_ABBREVIATION\/task.create.draft\/template.html` _custom to an agency if it exists_\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\n\r\nPart-Time Opportunity - Someone has just applied\r\nDear:\r\n\r\nYou have a new applicant for your opportunity. Their profile can be viewed here <insert link to profile>.\r\n\r\nAll applicants have self-certified that they meet eligibility requirements.  \r\n\r\nPlease follow the steps below:\r\nReview all candidates and select your top pick(s).  If needed, reach out to those candidates to discuss the opportunity and ask any questions you may have about their profile or statement of interest. Once you are ready to make your selection, we encourage you to contact the selected applicant's supervisor to confirm that he\/she is on board with the employee's participation.\r\nContact the selected candidate and discuss next steps for beginning the opportunity. You must also assign the opportunity in the system by doing the following:\r\nClick to Edit your opportunity\r\nRemove the non-selected participants from the opportunity under the \u201cParticipants\u201d section\r\nChange the opportunity state to \u201cAssigned.\u201d  This will send notifications to the candidates.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at gsarotationprogram@gsa.gov.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n<signature>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThis has already been partially implemented. We're just looking for some help to complete the work.\r\n\r\n## General acceptance criteria\r\n- Test coverage stays the same or increases\r\n- Tests pass\r\n- **A payment URL is specified in your micro-purchase profile so we can pay the award**",
